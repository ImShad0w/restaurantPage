# Restaurant page

Barebone restaurant page using:

- Webpack
- Modules

## Setup

Install the following dependecies as dev:

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
npm install --save-dev html-loader
```

## Usage

To **bundle** the page use:

```
The output file will be located at **dist/**

## Server

If you don't want to bundle everytime you make a change in **src/**

# Things learned

I learned a lot about how the modules work and a bit about Webpack and the node dependency ecosystem.
